### boardcmp_key.txt
This file shows what boards are considered easy, medium, or hard in master_boardset_diffcmp.txt.
The file also details the predicted difficulty of boards in boardset_diffcmp1.txt, boardset_diffcmp2.txt, boardset_diffcmp2.txt. 

### usable_boards_diffcmp.txt
For the second user study, we generated approximately 10000 boards from the ASP. From those 10000, 500 solvable boards were chosen.
Finally, we sought 150 boards that met the criteria of being within one-half the maximum time-to-solve. However, we only received 148.
This file contains all 148 boards as frozensets, clyngor's output Python object for answer sets.
